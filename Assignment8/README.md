# Assignment 8 - Use of `std::vector<Template class>::iterator` Container in C++ STL

## Overview

This assignment involves use of `std::vector<Triangle>::iterator` to container (basically pointer) to loop through a vector to output a string to the file. For looping we are using `for_each()` function in the library **algorithm**.

1. **Iterators**
   - Use: `  std::vector<Triangle>::iterator start = triangles.begin();` we have used iterator object named **start** to reference the first element of the vector, and **end** to reference the last element. 
   - Iterator is a pointer to the objects in the container.

2. **for_each()**
    - Use: `for_each(start, end, [&dataFile](Triangle triangle){} );` for_each is the loop function in the library `<algorithm>` which takes 3 arguments,`for_each(vector.begin(), vector.end(), func() )`.
    - We have used lambda function in the for_each loop as the third argument and Capture clause element as Datafile as a reference which is a `std::ostream` object.
